<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>
	I am an undergraduate physics student. When I'm not scratching my head over electrostatics problems, or normalising quantum wavefunctions, I spend a lot of my spare time programming. This portfolio
	showcases examples of what I have created. My language of choice is usually Python. This is mainly because of the matplotlib module, which offers powerful ways to visualise physical simulations in a small number
	of lines. However, I can also write simulations in C#, Java, or C++ if the situation calls for it (all three executing faster than Python).</p>
	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
	I first began programming at the age of 12, with the intention of writing mods for Minecraft. Thus Java was my introduction to the world of datatypes, objects, and algorithms.
	However, I came to appreciate the lack of boilerplate code required in Python. It is now the main language that I use to write small projects (such as those seen on this site).
	
	Other than programming, I also enjoy gaming, reading and astronomy. From a young age, my dream has been to go to space.</p>
